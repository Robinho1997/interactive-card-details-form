I created an interactive card detail form which is capable of :

⚪ live changing of the card details (name, number , cvc etc...)
⚪ after you submit instead of showing the form, showing a thank you message
⚪ responsive and working on all devices


I created this project before but at the beginning i didnt thought about the site being responsive and at the end I really didnt know what to change for it.

So i started again, thinking about doing it this time responsive.
With this in mind it was a much smoother experience.
I didnt wanted to use fixed width and heights but for the cards i didnt see any other way, so i used media queries to size the cards down for mobile users.

The javascript part was suprisingly easy.

All in all i had some struggles with this project but i really enjoyed to solve it.
